![Automatic Fish Feeder](images/fish_feeder.jpg)

The Automatic Fish Feeder is a handy embedded system project designed to simplify the task of feeding your aquatic pets. Developed by a collaborative team of enthusiasts, this project combines electronics, programming, and design to create a convenient solution for fish owners.

## Features

1. **Automatic Feeding**: The feeder is equipped with a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module that triggers feeding at predefined intervals, ensuring your fish are fed regularly even when you're not around.

2. **Instant Feeding**: With the press of a button, you can instantly dispense food to your fish outside of the scheduled feeding times.

3. **Time Editing**: Easily adjust the feeding schedule by entering edit mode, where you can increment or decrement the feeding time using dedicated buttons. Confirm changes by pressing the edit button again.

4. **RTC Time Sync**: Synchronize the device's internal clock with real-world time by toggling RTC edit mode. Hold down the edit button to enter RTC editing mode, then adjust the time as needed.
